# FST-timer-setup
This is a simple timer set up that can be used in the forced swim test behavioral paradigm. It can be adapted to other experiments that require several timing patterns within the observation period.

The forced swim test is used in the assessment of depressive-like behavior in rodents. Briefly, the rats are placed in a circular cylinder containing water and allowed to swim for a particular period. 
Time is noted when the rat are placed in the water, and are allowed to acclimitise to the swimming envronment for 1 or 2 minutes after which measures (time spent) of immobility, climbing or swimming is noted for the next 4-5 minutes. Ideally, this experiment is done by 1 or 2 experimenter. one to place the animals and the other to monitor time using different clocks and stop watches. 
This setup elimiinates the presence of 2 experimenter to one, and also saves the expermenter from using staring at clocks to know when to begin or stop. This affords him/her to focus on observing the behavior of the animals during the test. 
Having one person suring test also reduce the influence that presense of humans may have on animal behavior.
